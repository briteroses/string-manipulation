As a result, the core collapses under its own immense gravity, leading to a supernova explosion that ejects the star's outer layers into space. If the remaining core mass is sufficiently large--typically more than about 2.5 times the mass of the Sun--it collapses to a point of infinite density known as a singularity, surrounded by an event horizon.

This event horizon marks the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the black hole's gravitational pull, rendering the black hole invisible and detectable only by its gravitational effects on nearby matter and radiation."""
