Experiment #1:
for a range of k = 1, 2, 3, â€¦, randomly sample k invertible string transformations from our library
and evaluate with a jailbreak prompt instructing the model to do the composed transformation.
Evaluate the resulting ASR across different mapping sizes across different scales of the same model family.
