Experiment #4:
ICL to push complex transformations through.
The Wei & Steinhardt paper noted that GPT-4 doesn’t understand ROT13, but I don’t think they used ICL examples;
would GPT-4 be able to do ROT13 if ICL was supplied?
Super small and simple experiment, maybe intended to be done before Experiment #3 to gain intuition on that experiment.
